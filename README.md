# ICT (C# programming)
## Introduction to C#
C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in the .NET ecosystem. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components. Since its origin, C# has added features to support new workloads and emerging software design practices.
C# is used for:
* Mobile applications
* Desktop applications
* Web applications
* Web services
* Web sites
* Games
* VR
* Database applications
* And much, much more!
